# Chaser
NeoPixel random strip runners

  Chase is Arduino code that spews out random colored pixels traveling at random speeds
  down a NeoPixel strip. There are a predetermined number of pixels
  traveling the strip; when one gets to the end a new one is 
  regenerated at the beginning. Defines control the number of chasers,
  and the speed range (min, max).
